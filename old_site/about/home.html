I am no coder but I write code. 

I am no journalist, but I've made news.

I am a writer, but I make pictures these days. 

So call me all, but not one of these things.

If I had a name for what I was, I would name it. But my job is to find a new name for what I do. 

Until I find it I am a writer, an artist, a designer.
 I am poet-tongued and keyboard-fingered. I make rhythms of thought and not sound.

I want to be around the people whose thoughts are so big the internet must stretch to fit them. 

I want to be around the people who are building not only a new world, but also its physics as well. 

My real name is Michaela Stone Cross. 

My fake name is Rosalie C. Chasm. 

I am a storymaker, and sometimes I even make stories that're real. 

I'm working hard to build all these stories into one site.
