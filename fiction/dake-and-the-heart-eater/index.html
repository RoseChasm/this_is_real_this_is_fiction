"A murder of crows that literally steals a girl's heart. A traveler named Dake, just passing through. A dog named Santish who knows the secret of every city. A mayor whose power comes from a gruesome source. 

Enter the Golden City, a city like every other in which no one looks up, and follow Dake as he journeys to uncover the city's secret, and learns for the first time the taste of a human heart.">
