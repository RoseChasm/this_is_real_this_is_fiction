<span><p>To those who gave me a place to stay:</p></span>

<p>To Stuart McMillan of London, for Christmas songs and 3AM tea… </p>


     <p>To Josh Lieber of Cambridge, for mulled wine and Sweeney Todd…</p>

     To Janis of Latvia, for a Soviet cabin in the woods…
     
…You helped give me momentum.


To my muses…

     ...Rasmus Schanke of Oslo, James Chew of Liverpool, Dake Kang of Nowhere/Everywhere,      Audrey of Belize and Kevin Suarez of Chicago...

…you gave me adventure, inspiration, and great personalities to put to the page.



To my editor James Grove, who told me once that I was a great writer, and many more times that I was a cunt. 

To my not-editor Josh Lieber, who kept telling me I was a genius so often I started believing him. 

To my business partner Kevin Suarez, for helping me with coding, life, and surviving the wolves. 

To my mentor Greg Lobanov, for always helping me get started. 

To Jacquie Nesbitt, Caety Klingman, Daichi Ueda, Annie Wu, for being great suggesters/bug-catchers/adventure-friends. 

To my advisor Vu Tran, for begging me to stay in school.

To Erin Nerstad, for dealing with this most-peculiar project.

And most importantly to the Padres, for giving me life, and never doubting that it was a great idea.

Thank you.
